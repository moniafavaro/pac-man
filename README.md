# Description

This is my first project from the General Assembly course SEI-59.

Design a grid-based game using HMTL, CSS and JavaScript. The game should be playable for one player and the player must be able to win and lose. Timeframe: 1 week.

# Deployment

# Inpiration 

This project was my first one with JavaScript. Pac-Man was my choice because of lots of memories that I have from my childhood. The theme is inspired in Harry Potter World, with Lord Voldemort as the main character.

# Getting Started

To start with this project I firstly used pseudo code, where I wrote step by step how I wanted my code to work, or what I want my code to have.

In the beginning it had a maze and a voldy-man.

Then the voldy-man should be able to walk through the maze, not being able to pass through the walls. So the walls should be solid and the player will not pass through them.

After that I added the 'scars' or the 'get points' in all empty spaces in the maze.

The hardest part was to add the 'noses'. I started with one nose, and make it walk freely in the maze. But it wasn't to smart.

With the first nose running free, the next challenge was when the nose is in the same 'block' as the player, the player loses one life and go back to the initial point.

When this first nose was working 'perfectly' and removing one life from the player I added two more noses.

So the NVP was done, but I wasn't happy, I wanted more levels.

The second level starts when voldy-man catch all 'scars'.

On the second level I added more noses and made them walk faster.

The third and last level has more noses and they walk even faster.

To finish the game you just need to catch all 'scars' of all levels and have at least one life.

And you can see your score on the scoreboard.
