# Inpiration 
This project was my first one with JavaScript. Pac-Man was my choice because of lots of memory that I have from my childhood. The theme is inspired in Harry Potter World, with Lord Voldemort as the principal character.

Lord Voldemort as Pac-Man, need to run from the 'noses' and colect all the scars(in the shape of a lightning bolt). The mission is to pass all three levels, who will increase the number os noses at it one.
